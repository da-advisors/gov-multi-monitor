description: The Air Toxics Screening Assessment (AirToxScreen) is EPA's ongoing review of air toxics in the United States, developed as a screening tool for state, local and Tribal air agencies to help identify which pollutants, emission sources and places they may wish to study further to better understand any possible risks to public health from air toxics. AirToxScreen gives a snapshot of outdoor air quality with respect to emissions of air toxics. It suggests the long-term risks to human health if air toxics emissions are steady over time. AirToxScreen estimates the cancer risks from breathing air toxics over many years. It also estimates chronic noncancer hazards for some pollutants, including diesel particulate matter (PM). AirToxScreen calculates these air toxics concentrations and risks at the  census tract level (for 2017, 2018, and 2019 AirToxScreen versions) or the census block level (for the 2020 AirToxScreen version and beyond). It only includes outdoor sources of pollutants.
